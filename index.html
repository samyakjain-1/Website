                        efficient systems. I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at University of
                        Wisconsin-Madison.<br><br>

                        As a child, I was fascinated with the world of computers and software,
                        captivated by how these
                        machines could solve problems and create endless possibilities. This early curiosity grew into a
                        passion for exploring the field of computer science. Today, that passion has grown my interest
                        in machine learning, artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs), and computer
                        vision.<br><br>

                        Through my coursework at UW-Madison, I have developed a strong foundation in
                        both theoretical
                        and practical aspects of computer science. I have gained proficiency in programming languages
                        like
                        Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, alongside essential tools like Git, Bash, Eclipse,
                        VSCode, and PyCharm. I have also learned concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, Data
                        Structures and Algorithms. These skills have enabled me to approach complex problems with
                        confidence and creativity.
